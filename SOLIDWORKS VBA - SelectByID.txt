'This macro opens a SolidWorks drawing, selects a specific drawing view, and prepares it for further actions.
'The SelectByID2 method can be used to select almost any entity in SolidWorks, such as drawing views, faces, edges,
'features, sketch entities, etc., by specifying the appropriate ID type (e.g., "DRAWINGVIEW", "FACE", "EDGE", etc.).
'In this case, it selects a drawing view by its name. The flexibility of SelectByID2 allows you to interact with
'various entities programmatically, based on their names or IDs.
