1. Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations.

    +: Addition
    -: Subtraction
    *: Multiplication
    /: Floating-point division
    \: Integer division
    Mod: Remainder division

2. Comparison Operators

These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (True or False).

    =: Equal to
    <>: Not equal to
    >: Greater than
    <: Less than
    >=: Greater than or equal to
    <=: Less than or equal to
    Like: Pattern matching (with wildcards)
    Is: Checks if two object variables refer to the same object
    TypeOf ... Is: Checks the type of an object variable

3. Logical Operators

These operators are used to combine conditional statements.

    And: Returns True if both conditions are true.
    Or: Returns True if at least one condition is true.
    Xor: Returns True if exactly one of the conditions is true.
    Not: Reverses the value of the condition.
    Eqv: Returns True if both conditions are logically equivalent.
    Imp: Conditional implication (if the first is true, the second must be true).

4. Concatenation Operators

These operators join strings together.

    &: Concatenation with implicit string conversion.
    +: Concatenation without implicit string conversion (can cause errors if used with non-string values).
